2.1
  a. Both local search algorithms solve the problem equally well, it seems.
  b. Hill climbing was significantly faster (by a factor of 100).
  c. It does make a difference. Because as it increases, the amount of hill that the hill-climbing algorithm
        has to climb increases as well.
  d. Changing the delta step value doesn't make either of them faster, but it does make them (occasionally)
        get an incorrect answer.
  e. This is the function that determines the decay in probability that the simulated annealing function
        jumps to the side (to avoid the pitfalls of the hill-climbing algorithm).

2.2
  a. Simulated annealing finds a higher maximum most of the time. This is because it isn't stuck on the track
        that it begins on, like hill-climbing is.
  b. The starting point makes a huge difference here, with both of the functions finding better solutions
        the higher your starting point.
  c. With a much larger delta, both functions started finding answers in the negatives. I am not sure why this is,
        since an absolute value function like this can never be negative.
  d. The max for this function is 30, which I saw the simulated annealing algorithm get several times. I never saw
        hill-climbing get it. The minimum is zero, and I never saw either of them get that, so that's good.
        overall, simulated annealing did much better on average.
