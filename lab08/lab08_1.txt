a)
The Pearson correlation coefficient measures linear correlation between two variables. It is between -1 and 1, with
-1 being total negative linear correlation and 1 being total positive linear correlation (and 0 being no correlation
at all). The correlation between total rooms and total bedroom is almost 1.0 (0.9), which makes a lot of sense because
larger houses (i.e. ones with more total rooms) also tend to have more bedrooms; that is, bedroom count intuitively would
scale linearly with total room count. And that appears to be the case.

b)
Task 1:
minimal_features = [
    "housing_median_age",
    "population"
]

Task 2:
N.B. I went with one of their examples, because I couldn't think of other interesting features to do with latitude.

def select_and_transform_features(source_df):
  selected_examples = pd.DataFrame()
  selected_examples["distance_from_san_francisco"] = abs(source_df["latitude"] - 38)
  return selected_examples

My error started at just over 230 and lowered itself over the course of 9 periods to 183, which is unfortunately higher
than Google's example.
