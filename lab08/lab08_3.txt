a)
Seaborn seems overall like it requires more configuration at an individual level than matplotlib. That being said, the
the greater level of customization can be a strength, if that is what you need.

b)
This dataset has about 400 rows, which seems a little too small to really draw clean conclusions out of, but large enough
to draw helpful and interesting examples from. So basically it is ideal for this education application.

c)
The prescribed normalization takes all the differing ranges of values and makes them all be roughly in the same range, so
that it is more easy to compare them.

d)
This is an example of mean absolute error, rather than linear error.

e)
They specifically say that this is the case to avoid overfitting. This make intuitive sense to me, because you want your
network to be appropriate to your problem and to the data that you have available. If your network is too powerful and
complicated, you run the risk of it drawing conclusions too strongly from your data. In contrast, if you have enough data,
your model is going to be more comprehensive, and so you can support a more complicated network.
