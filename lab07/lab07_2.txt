a)
Categorical data is textual, while numerical data is (you guessed it!) numerical. They do say that sometimes you want to
treat numerical data as categorical, though, so it isn't quite as cut and dried as the categories may imply.

b)
Task 1:
I achieved an eventual RMSE of <180 merely by increasing the learning rate by a factor of 10. My hyperparameters were:
    learning_rate = 0.0001
    steps = 100
    batch_size = 1
    with an RMSE (after a few periods) of: 167.37

Task 2:
    train_model(
        learning_rate = 0.0001,
        steps = 100
        batch_size = 1
        input_feature = "population"

c)
Hyperparameters are the parameters not of the data, but of the ML algorithm that is operating on and learning from the
data. There is no standard algorithm for tuning them although there are rules of thumb; it varies depending on the
dataset, and just takes some tweaking on a case-by-case basis.
