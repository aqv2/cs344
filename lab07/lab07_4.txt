a)
Task 1:
I'm confused by the median_income values. 4.1 what? This data needs units or something.
The other data looks pretty reasonable to me. The std of the latitude and longitude definitely makes it look like
these houses are all in the same-ish region, although I personally have no idea if that region is in CA.

Task 2:
I genuinely had no idea about this one. They say that the training/validation data split was likely flawed, but I'm
not sure why that is the case.

Task 3:
I don't see any bugs, although they did comment out the randomization, which seems like its probably a bad move . . .

Task 4:
I had no idea what to do in this exercise. They eventually arrive at a training model that makes some sense to me.

Task 5:
Again, I didn't know what they wanted me to code, I definitely don't have the familiarity with Tensorflow to do
what they eventually, in the solution, show you. But what they did makes sense to me, in general.

b)
It is important to split your data randomly between training and validation datasets, to ensure that no odd biases
slip into what you are doing. In addition, you should verify your results with a testing dataset to make sure that your
case is not an outlier in the set of cases.
