a)
Task 1:
california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = (california_housing_dataframe["total_rooms"] /
    california_housing_dataframe["population"])

Task 2:
NOTE: These first two lines are nowhere in the scatter docs that they link, and I don't know how they expected me to know
    to do them . . .
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6))
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.scatter(calibration_data["predictions"], calibration_data["targets"])

Task 3:
california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = (california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"]).apply(lambda x: min(x, 5))

b)
Synthetic features allow you to sort of build your own features out of the dataset to train your model on. Which can
help you learn more about your dataset by empowering you to ask deeper questions and get deeper answers.

c)
Outliers are values that appear to be exceptions to a trend in the values of a data. They are usually clipped (after being
carefully considered to ensure that they don't represent very meaningful data).
