For my final project, I propose to build a neural network trained to generate poetry. The specific technologies I will use will include Keras (for the actual neural network modeling, etc), and the online Poetry Database located here (http://poetrydb.org/index.html), which has roughly three thousand individual poems, from about 130 poets. This includes many of Shakespeare's sonnets, the Holy Sonnets of John Donne, the entirety of John Milton's Paradise Lost, and much, much more. It is all easily accessible in JSON via a simple web API. If I cannot get consistent output due to the variety of the input, I will limit it to just Shakespeare, or just Milton, or something like that.
The plan is to take all of that data and parse it appropriately, feed it to a neural network (probably a recurrent one) and have the trained network generate poetry. This will probably be done at the level of individual characters, rather than words, as I think that more fine-grained approach may yield more interesting results.
