a)
There are times where it may perform better or more efficiently than a deep NN, but generally no.

b)
Yes it does, but not by very much.

c)
Embeddings appear to actually be harmful, lowering the accuracy by several percentage points.

d)
"Enjoyed" and "brilliant" are right next to each other. This makes sense, since brilliant is generally a positive adjective;
people are unlikely to describe somethin they didn't enjoy as brilliant.

e)
The best hyperparameters I found were 2 hidden layers of 10 and 5, with 10000 steps every layer. My accuracy was 0.8678.
This network took about 5 minutes to run through one set, though, so it is definitely not fast!
