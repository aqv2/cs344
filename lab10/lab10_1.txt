a)
I would rather use Keras, just because it makes (almost) everything more simple than TensorFlow. That being said, it
seems that TensorFlow has a convenient and Keras-y way to do layers with its "hidden_units" hyperparameter, which I
appreciate.

b)
Task 1:
dnn_regressor = train_nn_regression_model(
    learning_rate=0.001,
    steps=1000,
    batch_size=200,
    hidden_units=[50, 25],

Performance:
RMSE 113.33

Task 2:
Final RMSE (on test data): 111.32
