a)
It shows which digits we confused with other digits; i.e. which digits look like the wrong type of digit to our NN.

b)
The TensorFlow architecture is significantly more fine-tunable in its setup than the Keras architecture. In addition,
the TensorFlow architecture has two hidden layers of 100 RELU nodes each, which is much larger (and more slow)
than our Keras architecture.
I could make no improvements to the original architecture that they had. Every change I made just had a worse performance.

c)
The confusion matrix is much, much more full of errors at 10 steps vs 1000. 1000 is clearly better, here.
