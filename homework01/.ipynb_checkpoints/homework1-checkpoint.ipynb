    "1: Introspection would not be particularly helpful when it comes to informing AI how to model human cognitive processes. This is because the only reason introspection is necessary is to inform ourselves of our processes. We are often unaware of our own patterns and habits of thinking, and introspection is an attempt to get at those patterns and habits and to become self-aware in that area. In contrast to humans, an AI is just it's pattern and habit; there is nothing for it to not be \"self-aware\" of in the first place. There is no hiding an AI from itself, but human beings engage in self-deception all the time."
