Excercise 1
i. The dataset on Kaggle is 25000 images, but we only use 2000 in this excercise.

ii. It performs far, far better, but we later learn that we are massively overfitting, and I don't think we were in class.

iii. It looks like the net learns to look for the curvature of the cat's back, which is interesting, I think. And makes
sense, given the angle people tend to photograph cats from.

Excercise 2
i. Data Augmentation mutates the data in some predictable way so that the model never sees the same exact picture twice.

ii. The best results gave about 77% accuracy, with 10 steps per epoch, and 25 validation steps (and 30 epochs, as per
the instructions).
