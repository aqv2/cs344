a)
We do this because it makes for smaller, more efficient models of the data that we care about. It also helps avoid overfitting.

b)
If we have a bunch of features that we can determine are not particularly relevant to the question at hand, we can choose
to ignore them, which makes everything run more smoothly and helps avoid overfitting of the model.

c)
I managed to achieve LogLoss of 0.25, with model size of 755, using a gamma of 0.01.
